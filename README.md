# Automatic kidney segmentation in ultrasound images using subsequent boundary distance regression and pixelwise classification networks-TensorFlow

This is an implementation of the proposed model in TensorFlow for kidney ultrasound image segmentation.

Model Description:

We first use deep neural networks pre-trained for classification of natural images to extract high-level image features from US images. 
These features are used as input to learn kidney boundary distance maps using a boundary distance regression network and the predicted boundary distance maps are classified as kidney pixels or non-kidney  pixels using a pixelwise classification network in an end-to-end learning fashion. 
We also adopted a data augmentation method based on kidney shape registration to generate enriched training data from a small number of US images with manually segmented kidney labels.

We refer to the boundary distance regression network followed by post-processing for segmenting kidneys as a boundary detection network (Bnet)

Requirements:

The proposed networks were implemented based on Python 3.7.0 and TensorFlow r1.11

Training:

We initialized the network from the VGG_16.npy
